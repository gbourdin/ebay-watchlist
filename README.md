ebay-watchlist
---------------

This is a personal project to help me keep track of ebay auctions
published by a select list of sellers in very specific categories.

I built this because I wanted to know when my favourite sellers create
new listings for musical instruments in the hopes of catching a great
deal without having to manually visit their stores every day.
